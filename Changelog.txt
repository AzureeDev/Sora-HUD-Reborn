- Added an option to switch to font of the player name in the teammate panel. Choices are now Eurostile (default) or Font Large.
- Added a background behind the player name, to make it more visible.
- Special equipment will not overlap with player name anymore, and takes your peer color.
- Made the condition icon (tased, downed, custody) more darker, to see better when the timer goes below 10 seconds.
- Potential fix for avatar showing an X. Note this is happening sometimes when the game fails to fetch the avatar from Steam.
- Fixed the simplified Chinese localization
