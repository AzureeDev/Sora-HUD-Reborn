- Fixed some crashes

How are you by the way? I hope you're fine, I'm happy that you use my HUD, haha.
I gotta tell you a secret, in my life I would never expect doing so much for PAYDAY 2, even just LUA wise.
Started from nothing, learning all by myself for the most parts, and finally getting something big as this HUD.
Super proud of it. And I really hope you like it as much as I had fun coding, polishing it.

Take this virtual cookie. You deserve it.
