- Added custom loc combobox (Not all game languages support specific languages.)
- Added "Ask a request or report an issue" button in the Control Panel
- Added waifus :3 and potential sync with players that has the mod too.
- Fixed the issue #5. Status effects are now displayed for bots, and is correctly assigned to be on the health circle now.
- Hopefully fixed the changelog (FUCK YOU MODPATH :rage:)
